# For each country we get the ratio between US and that country's Numbeo
# Cost of Living Plus Rent Index value. Example: if Country A
# is 30% cheaper based on Cost of Living Plus Rent Index, then
# this country's `cost_of_living` is 0.7.
#
# Then, we want to slightly underpay people in expensive
# locations and not-so-slightly overpay people in cheap locations:
#  - in cheap locations, a MacBook costs the same (if not more);
#  - people in cheap locations can easily work remotely for a
#    company in a more expensive location;
#  - by overpaying cheap locations, we get access to top talent there;
#  - by underpaying expensive locations our hiring is harder there so
#    the culture fit must be greater.
#
# Additionally, we cannot afford to pay US-level salaries, so we
# set set our "affordability" ratio here, that we use to decrease
# `cost_of_living` values, which effectively decreases our salaries.
# The value is set somewhat arbitrarily, to match our salaries before
# the introduction of the Salary Calculator in Niteo. We adjust the
# "affordability" ratio in January, based on the previous year's
# performance.
#
# Finally for each country, we "compress" the `cost_of_living` towards
# our `affordability`. This means that if `cost_of_living` is higher
# than `affordability`, we decrease `cost_of_living` by 2/3 of the
# difference. If `cost_of_living` is lower than `affordability`, we
# increase `cost_of_living` by 2/3 of the difference.
#
# See `countries` and `compress_towards_affordability` functions in
# https://github.com/teamniteo/salarycalc/blob/master/fetch_config_values.py
# for exact details on these calculations.
